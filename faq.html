	  	  <h6>What/where/when?</h6>
	  <p> The AAAI/SIGAI-20 doctoral consortium is a unique venue for graduate students to present their research to established researchers in AI and fellow students.  Each accepted student is assigned a mentor who provides individualized feedback on the student's written research statement and oral presentation.  The DC will take place during the first two days of AAAI-20: February 7-8, 20 (New York, NY, USA).</p>
	  <p>&nbsp </p>

	  <h6>Where is the list of mentors?</h6>
	  <p>A list of mentors is determined after students are selected to participate.  The mentors you list on your application and the topic of your research are used to select your mentor. </p>
 	  <p>&nbsp </p>

	  <h6>Who should I list as potential mentors on my application?</h6>
	  <p>This is a great question.  Choose established AI researchers who have significant expertise in your area of research and who are not already in your immediate network.  Please do not list your advisor; this defeats the purpose of matching you with a mentor.  This is your chance to meet with and receive feedback from someone influential in your field!  If you do not know where to start, you can refer to the list of AAAI fellows and/or think about researchers who you frequently cite but have never met.  Your advisor may also have some ideas.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp </p>
 
	  <h6>Do I have to be a graduate student to apply?</h6>
	  <p>Yes.  The DC is intended to help graduate students who have settled on the overall direction of their thesis work, but who have not yet made significant progress on their thesis.  We believe that this is an ideal time for students to get feedback on their thesis.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp </p>
 
	  <h6>What is expected of participants of the DC?</h6>
	  <p>Students submit a two-page extended abstract describing their research as part of the application procedure.  Accepted students give an oral presentation of their research so far and a poster presentation at the main conference.  Accepted students are expected to attend both days of the DC to make the most of the experience for all attendees.  In the spirit of collaboration, students are encouraged to give feedback to their peers in addition to receiving it.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp </p>
 
	  <h6>Is there funding support for students?</h6>
	  <p>We are in the process of securing funding.  In the past we have been able to provide stipends to accepted students to partially cover their travel and lodging expenses.  Registration fees are typically waived for accepted students as well.  We will share more information when it becomes available.</p>
